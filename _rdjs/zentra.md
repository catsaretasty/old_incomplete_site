Hailing from the suburbs of Bowling Green, Ohio, Jamie Clair, also made known by his digital alias Zentra, has origins in a life that’s a bit more humble than most dance producers would claim to admit.
This, however, grants Zentra the immense amount of integrity that his image represents: he lets his craft speak for itself.
The level of uniqueness that Zentra’s music presents is literally mainstream-defying: when four-on-the-floor started to fade from the limelight, Jamie Clair took house music and, like a worn autumn coat, embraced its familiarity instead of shunning the monotony.
Fueled by melodic passion, quirky sound design and basslines filled to the brim with groove, Zentra will either make you smile or make you move. Your call.
