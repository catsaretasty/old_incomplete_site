Eluun is a young electronic music producer as well as a singer/songwriter, hailing from Nancy, France. Starting out as his alias 'Skynoize' in 2012, this later turned into his project 'Sian Area' which brought together a whole variety of flavors in eletronic music. The idea was to showcase music that had their own universes and histories. This ambitious project would lead to the creation of Eluun.

His musical style covers the entire electronic music spectrum, from glitch hop, complextro to dubstep and drum and bass, with festive energy and lively spirit. Eluun flexes his versatile skills taking on such a range of productions.
Live performance of his music has always been an important angle, with live instruments and unexpected new music taking the forefront.
